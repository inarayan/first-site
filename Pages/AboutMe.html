    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I am a backend developer who loves good design, good coffee, and good people. I work as a Back-end Developver in Infosys Limited.
      I love the web and all the awesome things that come out of it. I'm excited to live and work in a time of huge advances in web technology. It's easier than ever to share and collaborate with others, all because of the Internet.
      Education  and Hard work is  super important to me - I come from a family of farmer where I have learnt that excellence can be achieved through hardwork and there is no shortcut to success.</p>
